**Marketing Analytics Project: Time-Series Forecasting for Sales Strategy**

Led a data-driven marketing analytics project to investigate whether historical sales trends could effectively predict future outcomes, using a local stationery store as the case study.

**Objective:**
Forecast future sales using past transaction data to inform strategic retail decisions during high-variance periods.

**Tools & Techniques:**

* **Tableau** – Trend visualization and dashboard creation
* **Google Colab + ARIMA (1,1,1)** – Time-series forecasting
* **Excel** – Structured data cleaning and preprocessing

**Key Findings:**

* **Trend Analysis:**
  Identified a peak in sales on *Dec 31, 2023*, followed by a gradual dip in January, indicating a strong year-end surge followed by post-holiday normalization.
* **Forecasting Insight:**
  Trained an ARIMA model to predict February 2024 sales:

  * Early February: \~₹4,000/day
  * Mid to Late February: Plateau at \~₹5,346/day
  * Implication: Stabilized demand post-peak, indicating an ideal period for customer re-engagement strategies.
